Arduino-Based Conveyor Belt Control System
This project demonstrates a simple conveyor belt control system using Arduino. It employs two gear motors and two IR sensors to automate the operation of a conveyor belt.

Features:
Start Conveyor Belt: Activates the conveyor belt when the first IR sensor detects an object (sensor state is HIGH).
Stop Conveyor Belt: Deactivates the conveyor belt when the second IR sensor detects an object (sensor state is HIGH).
Components Used:
Arduino board
2 Gear motors
2 IR sensors
How It Works:
IR Sensor 1: When the first IR sensor detects an object, it signals the Arduino to start the conveyor belt by powering the gear motors.
IR Sensor 2: When the second IR sensor detects an object, it signals the Arduino to stop the conveyor belt by turning off the gear motors.
This project is ideal for learning basic automation and control systems. It can be easily modified for various applications or extended with additional features.
